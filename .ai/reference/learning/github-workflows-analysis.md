# Midday GitHub Workflows - The Deployment Orchestra

Hey! So you're looking at Midday's GitHub workflows - basically their entire CI/CD pipeline. Think of this as the backstage crew that makes sure every code change gets properly tested, built, and deployed without breaking anything. Let me walk you through what's happening here.

## Context: The Multi-Environment Deployment Machine

This setup is pretty sophisticated - they've got 10 different workflow files handling deployments across multiple environments and services. It's like having different assembly lines for different products:

**Production Workflows** (the main show):
- `production-api.yaml` - Deploys the tRPC API to Fly.io
- `production-dashboard.yml` - Deploys the Next.js dashboard to Vercel
- `production-engine.yml` - Deploys Cloudflare Workers
- `production-desktop.yaml` - Handles desktop app builds
- `production-email.yml` & `production-website.yml` - Email service and marketing site

**Preview/Beta Workflows** (the rehearsals):
- `preview-api.yaml`, `beta-dashboard.yaml`, etc. - Same as production but for testing

The smart part? Each workflow only triggers when relevant files change. So if you touch `apps/api/**`, only the API workflows fire up. It's like having motion sensors that only turn on the lights in the room you're actually using.

## How It All Works Together

The workflows follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Quality Gates**: Lint, TypeScript check, tests
2. **Build**: Compile and bundle everything
3. **Deploy**: Ship to the appropriate platform
4. **Special Sauce**: Background jobs deployment for the dashboard

The API workflows are twins - same steps, different destinations. Production goes to the main Fly.io app, preview goes to a staging environment. It's like having a dress rehearsal before opening night.

## Potential Use Cases & Expansion Ideas

**Current State**: They're already doing a lot right, but here's where it could get even better:

1. **Database Migrations**: I don't see any database migration steps. You could add Supabase migration runs before deployments.

2. **Integration Testing**: They're missing end-to-end tests between services. Could add a workflow that spins up all services and runs integration tests.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Could integrate Lighthouse CI for the dashboard, or API performance benchmarks.

4. **Security Scanning**: Add dependency vulnerability checks, SAST tools, or container scanning for the API.

5. **Feature Flag Integration**: Could add steps to sync feature flags or environment configs.

6. **Rollback Automation**: Add workflows that can automatically rollback on deployment failures or health check failures.

## Improvements & Pain Points

**The Good**: 
- Path-based triggering is chef's kiss
- Consistent quality gates across all services
- Smart use of concurrency groups to prevent deployment conflicts

**The Not-So-Good**:

1. **DRY Violation**: There's a lot of repeated code between production and preview workflows. You could create reusable workflow templates or composite actions.

2. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Dashboard tests are commented out (`# - name: ðŸ§ª Run unit tests`). That's a red flag - either fix the tests or remove them entirely.

3. **Memory Allocation Hack**: The dashboard TypeScript check needs `--max-old-space-size=8192`. That suggests either the codebase is getting unwieldy or there's a memory leak in the build process.

4. **Hardcoded Versions**: `trigger.dev@3.3.17` is pinned, which is good for stability but bad for security updates. Consider using dependabot or renovate.

5. **Secret Management**: Lots of secrets floating around. Could benefit from a secret rotation strategy or using OIDC for cloud providers.

**Quick Wins**:
```yaml
# Instead of repeating this everywhere:
- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
  with:
    bun-version: latest
- name: Install dependencies
  run: bun install

# Create a composite action:
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-bun-deps
```

## Responsibilities: The Division of Labor

Each workflow has a clear job:

**API Workflows**: The backend guardians
- Quality: Lint, TypeScript, tests
- Build: Engine dependency compilation
- Deploy: Fly.io with Docker

**Dashboard Workflows**: The frontend orchestrators  
- Quality: Same as API (minus working tests)
- Build: Vercel build process
- Special: Background jobs deployment to Trigger.dev
- Deploy: Vercel with custom domain aliasing

**Engine Workflows**: The edge computing specialists
- Quality: Standard checks
- Deploy: Cloudflare Workers with Wrangler

**The Pattern**: It's like having specialized teams - each knows their domain inside and out, but they all follow the same playbook for quality and deployment.

## The Bigger Picture

This setup screams "we've been burned by bad deployments before." The path-based triggering, quality gates, and environment separation show they've learned from experience. It's a mature CI/CD setup that prioritizes safety over speed - which is exactly what you want for a financial application.

The only thing missing is more observability into the deployment process itself. Adding deployment notifications, health checks, or rollback triggers would make this even more bulletproof.

Overall, it's a solid foundation that could use some DRY refactoring and test reliability improvements, but it gets the job done safely and efficiently.
