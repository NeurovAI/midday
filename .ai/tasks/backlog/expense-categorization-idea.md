# Smart Expense Categorization Feature

## Overview
Enhance Midday's Magic Inbox with intelligent expense categorization that automatically categorizes expenses based on merchant names, transaction amounts, and historical patterns.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users need to manually categorize their expenses after the Magic Inbox matches transactions. This creates additional work and potential for inconsistent categorization, especially for users with many transactions.

## Proposed Solution
Implement an AI-powered expense categorization system that:

1. **Automatic Categorization**: Uses machine learning to automatically assign categories to matched transactions
2. **Learning from User Behavior**: Learns from user corrections and manual categorizations to improve accuracy
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Provides confidence scores and alternative category suggestions
4. **Bulk Operations**: Allows users to apply categorization rules to multiple similar transactions

## Key Features
- Pre-trained categories (Office Supplies, Travel, Meals, Software, etc.)
- Custom category creation and management
- Merchant-based rules (e.g., "Amazon" → "Office Supplies" or "Software")
- Amount-based heuristics (e.g., small amounts from coffee shops → "Meals")
- Historical pattern recognition
- Confidence scoring for categorizations
- Easy correction interface with learning feedback

## Benefits
- Reduces manual work for users
- Improves consistency in expense tracking
- Provides better insights through accurate categorization
- Saves time during tax preparation and accounting
- Enhances the overall user experience of the Magic Inbox

## Technical Considerations
- Integration with existing Magic Inbox workflow
- Machine learning model for categorization
- User feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Database schema for categories and rules
- API endpoints for category management

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time spent on manual categorization
- Accuracy rate of automatic categorizations
- User adoption rate of the feature
- Decrease in support tickets related to expense management
